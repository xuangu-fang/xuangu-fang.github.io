I'm currently a **Senior Researcher** at **Microsoft Research Asia**. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science in Summer 2024 from the University of Utah. Prior to that, I earned my B.S. in both Statistics and Computer Science (double degree) from the School of the Gifted Young (少年班学院) at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2018, and my Master's in Computer Science from Temple University in 2019.

## Research Interests
- **Bayesian Methods and Generative Models**
- **Scientific Machine Learning for Physical Signal** 
- **Advanced Time Series (Tensor-valued Series, Spatial-Temporal data)**


## Industry & Application
- **AI4Science:**
 I've been involved in several research and start-up projects on AI + medical/bio scenarios. I own two first-author patents in [AIDD (AI for Drug Discovery)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d43747-021-00045-7), which contribute as core patents for a start-up that has raised over $10M+. 

- **AI4Finance:**
I have quite experiences of AI-based quantitative trading/pricing strategy development during the internship/competition in top hedge fund and investment bank ([Morgan Stanley](www.morganstanley.com), [World Quant](www.worldquant.com) and [UBS](www.ubs.com) etc.). During the Microsoft I'm a core contributor of ([MarS](https://github.com/microsoft/MarS/tree/main))(github 1.4K star), an open-source financial market simulation engine powered by generative foundation Model.

- **Others:**
I am a dedicated writer to introduce Bayesian machine learning (in Chinese) with more than 10,000 followers on Zhihu (知乎) — Chinese Quora. See my [Zhihu page](https://www.zhihu.com/people/fang-xuan-gu-19).


## News

- **May 2024**: I will join **Microsoft Research Asia** as a **Senior Researcher** in 2024 summer! Welcome to reach out for future collaboration if you are interested in my research.

- **May 2024**: One paper on online time-series Imputation is accepted by **ICML 2024** as **spotlight (top 3%)**! Thanks my collaborators in [DAMO Academy(达摩院) of Alibaba](https://damo.alibaba.com/?lang=en)!

<!-- Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

For more info
------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful. -->
